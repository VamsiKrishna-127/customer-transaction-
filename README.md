Customer Transaction Prediction
This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify whether a customer is likely to make a transaction based on anonymized features. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify customer behavior and provides a benchmark solution for transaction prediction tasks.

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Develop a binary classification model that predicts the probability of a transaction (target = 1 or 0) for each customer.

Evaluate various machine learning algorithms.

Analyze performance metrics and select the best-performing model for deployment or further research.

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for basic data insights)

Scikit-learn (ML algorithms and metrics)

XGBoost / LightGBM (used for model performance comparison)

🔍 Workflow Summary
Data Loading
Load and explore the dataset containing 200 anonymized features, an ID_code, and a binary target.

Data Preprocessing

Handling class imbalance (if needed)

Feature scaling or selection

Model Building & Evaluation

Multiple models were tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Best Model Selection
Based on evaluation, the best-performing model was selected and can be exported for future use.

📊 Results
The final model achieved the following:

High ROC-AUC score indicating strong separation between classes

Stable performance across folds in cross-validation

Balanced precision and recall for practical deployment

⚠️ Note: Feature names were anonymized, so domain-specific feature engineering was not possible.
